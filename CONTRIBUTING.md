# Contributing Guidelines â€“ Digital Fixed Deposit System

Welcome to the project! Please follow these guidelines to keep our workflow clean and consistent.

---

## ðŸ”‘ Branching Strategy
- Always create a new branch from `main`.
- Use the naming convention:
  - `feature/<name>` â†’ new features (e.g., `feature/frontend-login`)
  - `bugfix/<name>` â†’ bug fixes
  - `chore/<name>` â†’ minor changes (docs, configs)

Example:
```bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b feature/frontend-login
